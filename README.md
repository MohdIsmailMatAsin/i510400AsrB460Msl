> _**Remark:**<div align="justify">The settings above may not be the same as the recommended settings by Dortania. To find out more, please check [OpenCore Configuration](https://dortania.github.io/docs/release/Configuration.html), [Acidanthera Update : August 2021](https://dortania.github.io/hackintosh/updates/2021/08/02/acidanthera-august.html) and [Dortania, Apple Secure Boot](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/security/applesecureboot.html#securebootmodel) for SecureBootModel selection._</div>

</br>

## BIOS

**Legacy BIOS**<div align="justify">Legacy Boot refers to the boot process used by the BIOS firmware to initialize hardware devices. The Legacy boot contains a selection of installed devices that get initialized as the computer performs the **Post-Test** during the boot process. The legacy boot will check for all connected devices for the Master Boot Record (MBR), usually in the first sector of a disk. When it can’t find a bootloader in the devices, Legacy switches to the next device in the list and keeps repeating this process until it finds a boot-loader, or if not, returns an error.</div>

</br>

**Modern BIOS (UEFI)**<div align="justify">
UEFI, or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is a modern way of handling the boot process. UEFI is similar to Legacy, but the boot data is stored in a .efi file rather than the firmware. Most UEFIs can be entered by a special key. Below is common key used for certain motherboard manufacturer:</div>

| **MANUFACTURER** | **BIOS KEY** | **MANUFACTURER** | **BIOS KEY** |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| ASUS             | F8           | Intel            | F10          |
| Gigabyte         | F12          | Asrock           | F11          |
| MSI              | F11          | EVGA             | F7           |

> _**Remark:**<div align="justify">BIOS key in the table above is not entirely correct. The key is depending on how the manufacturer designs the board. Please pay attention. This is basic knowledge to understand how your motherboard works. It is better to refer to any source, especially your motherboard manufacturer, for a better understanding._</div>


</br>

**Legacy vs Modern**

| **LEGACY** 																														| **MODERN** 																																							|
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy Boot mode is traditional and very basic 																					| UEFI provides a better User interface 																																|
| Legacy uses the MBR partition scheme 																								| It uses the GPT partitioning scheme 																																	|
| It is slower compared to UEFI 																									| UEFI provides faster boot time 																																		|
| The MBR portioning scheme used by Legacy only supports up to 2 TB storage devices 												| Since UEFI uses the GPT partitioning scheme, it can support up to 9 zettabytes of storage devices. 																	|
| Legacy runs in 16-bit mode that only supports keyboard navigation 																| UEFI runs in 32-bit and 64-bit, allowing support for mouse and touch navigation 																						|
| It does not provide a secure boot method, which allows for the loading of unauthorized applications, making dual-booting possible | It allows a secure boot that prevents the loading of unauthorized applications. It may also hinder dual boot because it treats operating systems (OS) as applications |
| It is more complex compared to UEFI 																								| It has an easier update process 																																		|                                                     

</br>

**EFI**<div align="justify">Extensible Firmware Interface system partition, or ESP, is a partition on a data storage device (usually a hard disc drive or solid-state drive) that is used by computers having the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). When a computer is booted, UEFI firmware loads files stored on the ESP to start the installed operating systems and various utilities. The ESP contains the boot loaders or kernel images for all installed operating systems (which are contained in other partitions), device driver files for hardware devices present in a computer and used by the firmware at boot time, system utility programs that are intended to be run before an operating system is booted, and data files such as error logs.</div>

![efi-system-partition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/161425316-cb229e60-b2ad-4538-9b68-bbabb89a88a8.png)

</br>

**Boot-Loader**<div align="justify">The term boot-loader is a shortened form of the words [bootstrap loader](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/). The term stems from the fact that the boot manager is the key component in starting up the computer, so it can be likened to the support of a bootstrap when putting a boot on. It is a special operating-system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a boot-loader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computer’s firmware (e.g. BIOS) about where the boot-loader is. The whole process is also described as booting.</div>

## Partitioning

**Windows**<p align="center"><img width="827" alt="Screenshot 2022-04-03 133920" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/161430959-f530d4a2-812f-43ec-9b78-6b54522f3a50.png"></div>

</br>

**MacOS**<p align="center"><img width="830" alt="Screenshot 2022-04-03 134003" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/161430979-9b890a71-a348-439b-98df-0e53e6a49da8.png"></div>

> _**Remark:**<div align="justify">For dual or triple booting PCs, this application is very useful to manage Windows + MacOS or Windows + MacOS + Linux partition. [DiskGenius](https://www.diskgenius.com) or previously [Partition Guru](https://www.partitionguru.com) is a versatile program packed with comprehensive functions for partition recovery, file recovery, disk management, data backup, disk utilities, etc. It manages storage space with high efficiency, recovers data lost due to disk corruption, formatting, deletion, virus attack, etc. In other mean, DiskGenius is a simple tool that allows users to manage the partitions on hard drive and to format them, create new ones, or delete. This utility is compatible and works well with virtual hard drives like VMware, VirtualBox and Virtual PC in addition to supporting SCSI, IDE, SATA and USB flash drives or memory cards. The best thing is, this app capable to view and manage EFI/ESP partition which made managing partition so easily if any file required to be edit, especially [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) or [Clover](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader) config.plist. However, APFS and HFS+ is not fully supported. That's the weak spot of this application. To use APFS and HFS+ formats on windows, [Paragon Hard Disk Manager™ Community Edition](https://www.paragon-software.com/free/pm-express/?msclkid=b2537d35cbb811ecbee6e7525f1ca4a9) is adequate. Both combination support may improve user experience._</div>

## OpenCore Package & Preparation

**What is OpenCore**<div align="justify">Referred to as a package of boot-loader and also a [chain-loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_loadings) software. It is a complex software program, used to call the operating systems MacOS, Linux, and Windows. In addition, it also has the ability to inject new data into MacOS operating systems such as SMBIOS, Advanced Configuration Table and Power Interface (ACPI), and Kernel Extension (Kext). The package contains additional UEFI support common libraries shared by other projects in [Acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera). The primary purpose of the library set is to provide supplemental functionality for Apple-specific UEFI drivers. Key features:</div>

- Apple disk image loading support
- Apple keyboard input aggregation
- Apple PE image signature verification
- Apple UEFI secure boot supplemental code
- Audio management with screen reading support
- Basic ACPI and SMBIOS manipulation
- CPU information gathering with timer support
- Cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, RSA, etc.)
- Decompression primitives (zlib, lzss, lzvn, etc.)
- Helper code for ACPI reads and modifications
- Higher level abstractions for files, strings, UEFI variables
- Overflow checking arithmetics
- PE image loading with no UEFI Secure Boot conflict
- Plist configuration format parsing
- PNG image manipulation
- Text output and graphics output implementations
- XNU kernel driver injection and patch engine

**OpenCore Structure**

Below are the base OpenCore files and folders used for this project:

> _**Remark:** For the [debugging](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/debugging) process, it is best not to use [OpenCanopy.efi](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/cosmetic/gui.html)._

</br>

### OC\EFI

**Boot**<div align="justify">Fallback boot-loader path. This is the only boot-loader pathname that the UEFI firmware on 64-bit X86 systems will look for without any pre-existing NVRAM boot settings. Booting is a term used to refer to the initial loading process when we turn on the computer. BOOTx64.efi is a special file for the boot process that aims to link the boot-loader checked by the BIOS before the computer can be used. The boot programme and OpenCore.efi will be searched by the BIOS for UEFI on 64-bit X86 systems without any existing NVRAM boot settings.</div>

**Secure Boot**<div align="justify">Basically MacOS implements the same boot instruction as any other Operating System. But, secure boot works in a different approach. Mac computers equipped with a [T2 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_T2) have an added feature called secure boot. It prevents unsigned operating systems from running on your Mac. Secure boot helps protect against bootkits, or malware that infects the master boot record (MBR) on your computer. Please refer [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862) for more info.</div>

**Chain-Loader**<div align="justify">OpenCore capable of some other additional features. It has another mobile feature called chain-loader, which aims to call different operating systems.</div>

### OC\ACPI

</br>

**DSDT**<div align="justify">Differentiated System Description Table. It Is a major ACPI table and is used to describe what peripherals the machine has. Also holds information on PCI IRQ mappings and power management. In other mean, an OEM must supply a DSDT to an ACPI-compatible OS. The DSDT contains the Differentiated Definition Block, which supplies the implementation and configuration information about the base system. The OS always inserts the DSDT information into the ACPI Namespace at system boot time and never removes it.</div>

<p align="center"><img width="1109" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-04-30_at_3_41_29_PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/166096869-e6b7fe84-c465-4504-ab89-14b8887561ac.png"></div>

</br>

**SSDT**<div align="justify">In ACPI, peripheral devices and system hardware features on the platform are described in the Differentiated System Description Table (DSDT), which is loaded at boot, or in Secondary System Description Tables (SSDTs), which are loaded at boot or loaded dynamically at run time. For SoCs (System on Chip), the platform configuration is typically static, so the DSDT might be sufficient, although SSDTs can also be used to improve the modularity of the platform description. Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) are a continuation of the DSDT. Multiple SSDTs can be used as part of a platform description. After the DSDT is loaded into the ACPI Namespace, each secondary description table listed in the RSDT/XSDT with a unique OEM Table ID is loaded. This allows the OEM to provide the base support in one table, while adding smaller system options in other tables. Refer [Differentiated System Description Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/acpi-system-description-tables#differentiated-system-description-table-dsdt) for more info.</div>

</br>

**ACPI Machine Language (AML)**<div align="justify">Pseudo-code for a virtual machine supported by an ACPI-compatible OS and in which ACPI control methods and objects are written. The AML encoding definition is provided in section 19, [ACPI Machine Language (AML) Specification](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.4/20_AML_Specification/AML_Specification.html)</div>

</br>

**DSDT or SSDT?**<div align="justify">As documented by [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/ssdt-methods/ssdt-easy.html#running-ssdttime) , *"Do not add your DSDT to OpenCore; it's already in your firmware. If you are unsure what this is referring to, go back to the OpenCore guide and select your configuration based on the architecture of your CPU"*. Some computers come with a broken DSDT. It is usually not recommended to patch/override DSDT. Patching DSDT with garbage can do physical harm to computer. DSDT patches should be avoided. Some forums/websites (i.e., Olarila) state that it is a major solution. But, that reality isn't true. Since DSDT is the primary table, SSDT is the best way to make hackintosh PCs near as Mac. SSDT can be patched, modified (adding and dropping) the hardware properties which hook inside the machine. There are various reasons why DSDT patching is not recommended.</div>

</br>

**DSDT Patch** may cause

- ⚠️ Broken motherboard BIOS, or
- ⚠️ Inefficient device with the wrong injection, or
- ⚠️ Cause malfunction device, or
- ⚠️ PC unable to boot properly due to an incorrect patch (difficult to reverse).

</br>

**SSDT Patch** may affect

- ⚡ ACPI Injection to Windows/Linux.

**On Other Operating Systems, Avoid ACPI Injection**<div align="justify">Most of these issues may affect dual booting (Windows + MacOS). Luckily, there are settings via config.plist to prevent this issue, but this is only experimental. Do not assume these settings will work 💯 on your machine. Certain users report the settings are not working, but some report the settings work as well. These settings are actually used only for Dell machines. But it is worth a try. Settings are explained via the table below.</div>

| **SETTINGS**     | **Mode** | **DETAIL**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UpdateSMBIOSMode | Create   | Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk.  Setting to Custom with CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk enabled can also disable SMBIOS injection into "non-Apple" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk |
| CustomSMBIOSGuid | NO       | Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode set to Custom. Usually relevant for Dell laptops. Enabling this quirk with UpdateSMBIOSMode. Custom mode can also disable SMBIOS injection into "non-Apple" OSes however we do not endorse this method as it breaks Bootcamp compatibility. Use at your own risk                           |                              |

</br>

So, it should be...

- UpdateSMBIOSMode = **Custom**
- CustomSMBIOSGuid = **Yes**

</br>

**Solution**<div align="justify">SSDT patch is the better solution and more reasonable. Any addition or modification does not affect your machine. If an error occurs, it is easy to revert back to the original state. SSDT patch is minor modification and not affect the actual hardware performance. Using openCore debug, there are several other tables that work with OpenCore. However, modifications to other tables are not necessary. The purpose of the SSDT is designed as described in this section. Be reminded, only SSDT can be modified. The rest is no.</div>

</br>

**Patch Applied**<div align="justify">Thanks to CorpNewt cross platform SSDTTime hotpatch tool. In this project, various SSDT's has been merged into [one](https://github.com/MohdIsmailMatAsin/i510400AsrockB460MSteelLegend/blob/main/PCIInfo.txt). i.e., [SSDT-B460M-SL.dsl](https://github.com/MohdIsmailMatAsin/i510400AsrockB460MSteelLegend/blob/main/SSDT-B460M-SL.dsl). With several other sources, additional code is injected to reduce the kext workload. As example, GFX0 to an IGPU rename which handled by Whatevergreen.kext.</div>

### OC\Drivers

**Basic Drivers**<div align="justify">Only 2 basic driver types are needed here using the debug package. OpenRuntime.efi and HfsPlus.efi. Both files are essentially basic drivers to make this project work. Usage information is as follows:</div>

| Driver          | Information                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HfsPlus.efi     | Official HFS+ Driver Support for Apple MacOS                                                                                                                       |

</br>

### OC\Kext

**Kernel Extensions**<div align="justify">Apple regularly introduces innovative solutions and improvements to macOS. However, not all improved tools can fully replace their predecessors. This is what happened with kernel extensions and their successors, System Extensions and DriverKit. Kernel extensions (kexts) let users or developers load code directly into the MacOS kernel. The table below contains some kexts in this project used to properly boot MacOS through OpenCore.</div>

| Kext                | Information                                                                                                                              	|
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lilu                | Arbitrary kext and process patching on MacOS                                                                                              	|
| VirtualSMC          | System Management Controller (SMC) emulator layer                                                                                         	|
| AppleALC            | Enabling native MacOS HD audio for unofficial codecs                                                                                      	|
| Whatevergreen       | Various patches necessary for certain ATI/AMD/Intel/Nvidia GPUs                                                                          	|
| SMCProcessor        | Additional support for VirtualSMC. Used for monitoring CPU temperature                                                                    	|
| SMCSuperIO          | Additional support for VirtualSMC. Used for monitoring `FAN` speed                                                                        	|
| SMCRadeonGPU        | Based on FakeSMCs, RadeonMonitor to provide GPU temperature to a dedicated gadget                                                         	|
| RadeonSensor        | To read the GPU temperature. Lilu is required                                                                                             	|
| LucyRTL8125Ethernet | Ethernet device, Realtek RTL8125 2.5G bit Ethernet Controllers driver                                                                     	|
| USBMap              | Kext to route selected USB ports to Physical Ports via USB port address. This is compulsory to handle 15 port limit requirements by MacOS 	|

<p align="center"><img width="1032" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-04-25_at_3_00_24_PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/165037853-94893f7d-7950-447a-a57f-745e93fe9ce8.png"></div>

</br>

**Priorities:** The order of kexts is important, they are loaded in this order. Plugins for other kexts should always come after the main kext. Lilu should be first, then Lilu plugins like WhateverGreen and VirtualSMC. Sort in priority to get a better kext injection.

### OC\OpenCore.efi

**Firmware Interface**<div align="justify">An Extensive Firmware Interface (.efi) file is a system file used by Intel-based computer systems and computer devices such as AppleTVs. It contains system-level data that executes between the operating system and the firmware. An OpenCore Extensible Firmware Interface files are used for staging firmware updates, booting operating systems, and running pre-boot programs. Normally this file is include with OpenCorePkg and it is compulsory </div>

<p align="center"><img width="882" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-25 at 1 10 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/165024487-a626140e-fbf4-41b6-806f-7d1df76a95ec.png"></div>

</br>

### OC\Resources

**Audio, Font, Image & Label**<div align="justify">An OpenCore theme folder which is related to beauty treatment, contain audio (boot-chime), image (wallpaper/icon), font, and label for boot menu GUI experience. These files and folders only work with the OpenCanopy.efi driver. For a more detailed guide, see [OpenCore Beauty treatment](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Post-Install/blob/master/cosmetic/gui.md). This section can be skipped and can be done post-install. The package can be download [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData).</div>

</br>

### OC\Tools

**Auxiliary**<div align="justify">An additional auxiliary tool for OpenCore. Most of the tools are available in OpenCore packages. It is up to the user to figure out how to make the most of the tools provided. The tools are in .efi format. Here, CleanNvram.efi, which is a ResetNVRAM alternative bundled as a standalone tool, is used as an example. This tool will likely be used to remove any corruption of data in the NVRAM, whilst the resetnvram is used to wipe and clear (empty) the NVRAM. Other tools are designed according to a specific purpose. **Reminder:** Press spacebar on the boot menu to use CleanNvram.efi since it is set as an auxiliary (hidden).</div>

</br>

### OC\Config.plist

**Configuration**<div align="justify">A plist file is a settings file, also known as a properties file, used by MacOS applications. It contains properties and configuration settings for various programs. Plist files are formatted in **XML** and **based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD**. OpenCore/Clover benefit **.plist** to inject MacOS preference, also an information for the application that it holds the preference settings. Other than that, it's a markup language that shares a lot of similarities with HTML. This means you've got a few different data types available to you, and most of the structure revolves around keeping track of opening and closing tags. Besides, a plist is often used to correct problems that a user may be having with an application or devices.</div>

<p align="center"><img width="959" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-25 at 1 19 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72515939/165025284-c442cf30-0099-4f94-8634-19b9877d153a.png"></div>

**Example:** Below is an example of config.plist:

# OTHERS: ADDITIONAL INFO

## Quirks Check

**Read and Settings**<div align="justify">Quirks is depending on processor type (codename). Different type has different settings. Refer to OpenCore Getting Started and head to Configs. For easy settings, use OCAuxiliaryTools. However, this is not recommended. Any error that occurs in config.plist is your own responsibility. Manual setup is encouraged. Please make a backup before using it. While the quirks are set by processor code name, please read [OpenCore Getting Started](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html) for recommendations. Use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) or [Xplist](https://github.com/ic005k/Xplist) to manually edit quirks settings via config.plist. There is an easy way by using [OCAuxilliaryTools](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools). However, it is not recommended and may break the .plist.

## UHD Graphics 630 (Headless)

**AAPL,ig-platform-id**<div align="justify">This is an important part. The keyword for the best headless settings for desktop is **mobile**. For desktop **(iMac SMBIOS)**, the framebuffer setting for the **mobile** variant is not needed. Open **Hackintool > Patch > Platform ID** option. Find any setting which is not related to the mobile **(Mobile = No)**. This guide is to find a proper **AAPL,ig-platform-id** for Desktop. In this case, **0x3E910003** in hexadecimal, which is equal to **0300913E**, 4 byte data hex swapped. Below is an example:</div>

- 0x3E910003 = 0300913E
- AAPL,ig-platform-id = 0300913E

**device-id**<div align="justify">To get the proper main card platform as `headless` injection, `device-id` is required to get the device name. On `Intel 10th Gen` processor, it is not necessary, but sometimes this patch may fix certain IGPU issues. As an example, find **Activity Monitor > Window > GPU History** or **Activity Monitor > GPU** extra tab, IGPU will display as **Intel KBL Unknown**. Checkout [Issues #1905](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1905). To proper rename, use **Hackintool** as a guide by finding the appropriate **device-id**, not in mobile mode (Mobile = No). In this case, GPU Hexadecimal device-id 0x3E9B8086 which is equal to 4 byte data hex swapped 9B3E0000 is injected via config.plist in IGPU DeviceProperties section. Below is an example:</div>

- 0x3E9B8086 = 9B3E8086
- 9B3E8086 = 9B3E0000 (8086 to 0000)

## Update

**OCTool**<div align="justify"> A small project from the **Rust** language provides better OpenCore update features. Users can build from the included source by running **cargo build** --release or use the **binary** from the releases section on GitHub. This tool does not automatically update itself to the latest version. Watch [octool](https://github.com/rusty-bits/octool) guide via [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNzD08Hkxs&t=4s)</div>

Input:

`./octool` [options] `-o x.y.z` [config.plist]

`-d` to use debug versions for EFI instead of release versions

`-h` to print help/usage message

`-o x.y.z` is to select OpenCore version. e.g. `-o 0.7.4`

Without this option **octool** will make a "quick guess" as to which version to use based on the INPUT config.plist, if no INPUT config.plist is provided, **octool** will default to the latest version of OpenCore. Read more on [rusty-bits/octool](https://github.com/rusty-bits/octool)
